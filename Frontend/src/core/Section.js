                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Typing is all about muscle memory, so the only way to improve is to practice typing regularly. We created TheTypingCat to give you a tool to learn and practice touch typing in the most effective way. The process of developing proper habits requires you to train your fingers periodically and to be patient. You should first focus foremost on accuracy, ergonomics, and high typing speed will come with time. Not to overwork yourself. Remember, it is a marathon, not a sprint, it is better to take ten minutes exercises daily than a single one hour run.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">The WPM stands for words per minute, and it is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in the recruitment process and typing speed tests. It is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language. Make sure you start your touch typing with high accuracy. Your speed will grow over time.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">You should always start typing by placing your fingers on the home row. There are the small bumps on the F and J key, which indicate the initial position of your index fingers. It helps you find this starting position on the keyboard without looking at it. Once you start with this position, your fingers have the full range of motion and a proper distance to all keys. It is the most optimal hands placement during typing.</p>
